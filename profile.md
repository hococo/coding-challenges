Profile page exercise
====

This exercise is meant to show a command of the technologies we use, as well as a keen head for problem solving and
attention to detail. We ask to have the challenge returned within **three days** of it being assigned.

It should take approximately 3 hours to finish this task, but let us know if you need more time.

Feel free to use the technology/framework you are the most comfortable with (big plus if any of it includes PHP/Laravel/Vue.js!).

If you do not have time to finish the task, please leave comments describing how you would have implemented the missing
parts.

# The exercise

In our platform we have data on our tenants and users, some of which is displayed on a profile page for the staff members.
We want you to recreate this profile page based on the _design_, and make sure that it meets all standards for good code
and implementation.

The data for the view is coming from multiple endpoints, which you will mock using the JSON data provided below:



## Prerequisites

1. Create the view based on the design and the data coming from the JSON outputs.
2. Make the view responsive.
3. Add validation for the fields, according to whatever validation rules you feel are appropriate.
4. Add some caching for the data coming from the unit "endpoint".
5. Add functionality to edit and save the data (no true persistence is needed).

# How to hand it in

Please upload your solution to a git repository (BitBucket, GitLab or GitHub) and provide a README.md file with
documentation, including how to run your solution, then send us a link to the repo (make sure it's public or otherwise
accessible).

Feel free to describe what you would have improved in your solution if more time was given!
