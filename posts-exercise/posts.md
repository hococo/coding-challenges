Posts exercise
====

This exercise is meant to show a command of the technologies we use, as well as a keen head for problem solving and attention to detail. We ask to have the challenge returned within **three days** of it being assigned.

Aim to do the task within 4 hours. If you do not have time to finish it all, please leave comments describing how you would have implemented the missing parts, and/or why you have made certain compromises.

### The exercise

In this exercise, you will be working with a list of posts.

We want you to recreate this list based on the design here: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/ynXV5sipW3kKhCnoRBFtOu/front-end-task-posts?t=QsYkOxdVS9Giw8hJ-1).

In the following exercise, certain design elements of the solution are provided via the design in Figma, while other elements of the solution have been left out in order for you to come up with an implementation. Try to replicate existing elements as accurately as possible, and try to match the styling of any additional elements you need to create to the existing design.

The solution should:

* Display a list of posts, paginated into chunks of 20.
* Display the next chunk of posts when the user scrolls down far enough (i.e. infinite scrolling).
* Provide functionality to add a post. This added post should appear in the list of posts.
* Provide functionality to edit posts. The changes should be reflected in the list of posts.

Optional - feel free to tackle these additional challenges, or consider how you would solve them if you had more time:

* Provide functionality to search posts.
* Add some error handling, in case the API throws an error.
* Display other attributes of each post, such as tags, views or reactions.
* Provide options to sort the list of posts.

The data for posts should come from this API: [DummyJSON - Posts](https://dummyjson.com/docs/posts).

### Requirements:

* Ensure that the page is responsive and looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
* Use any JS framework or vanilla JS for creating the solution (big plus if you are using Vue.js, but it is certainly not a requirement!).
* Feel free to use any JS packages as well.
* You can use any CSS frameworks (e.g., Tailwind) or custom CSS to style the page.

### How to hand it in 

Please upload your solution to a git repository (BitBucket, GitLab or GitHub) and provide a README file with
documentation, including how to run your solution, then send us a link to the repo (make sure it's public or otherwise
accessible).
